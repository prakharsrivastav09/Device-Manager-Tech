# Device-Manager-Tech
This project is a simple device simulator implemented in Java. It mimics the behavior of a device by generating simulated data for various parameters such as A, B, DO1, DO2, and Tx (temperature).

The DeviceSimulator class contains methods to generate simulated data, configure inputs A and B, and display a main menu for the user to choose options. The user can choose to generate simulated data or configure inputs A and B. The program continues to display the main menu until the user chooses to exit.

Overall, this project provides a basic framework for simulating device behavior and interacting with it through simulated inputs.
